= About Identity Management
:keywords: anypoint platform, permissions, configuring, pingfederate, saml

This topic provides an overview of identity management on Anypoint Platform. As the Anypoint Platform organization administrator, you set up users for single sign-on (SSO) by configuring identity management in Anypoint Platform using one of the following single sign-on standards:

* OpenID Connect
+
End-User identity verification by an authorization server including SSO
+
* SAML 2.0
+
Web-based authorization including cross-domain SSO

Service initiated-SSO is not supported. 

The following diagram shows the SAML identity management process:

Before configuring OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0, you need to select an identity management provider (IdP). If you intend to use OpenID Connect, choose an OpenID Connect-compliant provider, such as PingFederate, OpenAM, or Okta; otherwise, choose any SAML 2.0-compliant provider. The following SAML providers have been successfully tested with Anypoint Platform:

* PingFederate
* OpenAM
* Okta
* Shibboleth
* Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
* onelogin
* CA Single Sign-On

Regardless of the IdP you select, be sure to familiarize yourself with its documentation.
After youâ€™ve made your selection, you are ready to set up your Anypoint Platform organization as your audience in your IdP configuration, as well as configure identity management in the Anypoint Platform master organization. The IdP you use is effective for the entire organization and all business groups. Configure attribute names on the IdP and Anypoint Platform to match.

Follow the procedures to configure OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 in this documentation. 

Once your organization's IdP has been configured, you can test the integration by visiting your organization's login URL. Your organization's login URL will be `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/{organization-domain-name}`. You can find your organization's domain name by logging into Anypoint with your administrator account, visiting Access Management -> Organization, and then clicking on your organization's name. Look for the value in the "Domain name" field.

When you visit your organization's login URL, you will be redirected to your IdP where you will authenticate. After authenticating, you will be redirected back to Anypoint as an authenticated user.

== FAQs

*Q: What happens when a user logs into the configured IdP for the first time?*

A: An Anypoint user is created in your organization using the user's IdP information, including username, name, and email.

*Q: What happens when a user updates their profile information in the configured IdP?*

A: After logging into Anypoint via the IdP, the user's profile information will be updated within Anypoint.

*Q: How does Anypoint select a username for an IdP-authenticated user under OpenID Connect?*

A: Typically, the OpenID Connect userinfo endpoint should provide a `preferred_username` claim that Anypoint will use for the user's username. However, some IdPs such as OpenAM and PingFederate don't support the `preferred_username` claim. Therefore, when creating an Anypoint user from OpenID Connect claims, Anypoint will use the `email` and `sub` claims as fallback values for the username if the `preferred_username` claim is not present.

*Q: What happens when you turn identity management off for your organization?*

A: The external identity provider configuration is removed from Anypoint, but Anypoint will remain as a client application in your IdP. Follow link:conf-openid-connect-task#manual-client-registration[manual registration steps] to reconnect the existing client application.

*Q: What happens when you remove a user from your IdP?*

A: The user will no longer be able to authenticate through the IdP, but their user information will remain in your Anypoint organization.
